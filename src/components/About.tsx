					We believe in community through friendship, and knowledge through
					community. We publish words not only in print, but on everyday and
					fine art objects. We hope to proliferate theory, cultural mythologies,
					and the work of emerging/underrepresented writers––areas especially
					important to us as queer artists of color. We want words in your
					kitchen and your bathroom and your car (if you have one) and on your
					body and head and feet (if you have them).
				</p>
				<p>
					Active Chapter is made by artists Eka Savajol, Lucia Mumma, Max Chu,
					and XY Zhou. Our intern is Jojo Savajol.
