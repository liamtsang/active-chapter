					We believe in community through friendship, and knowledge through
					community. We publish words not only in print, but on everyday and
					fine art objects. We hope to proliferate theory, cultural mythologies,
					and the work of emerging/underrepresented writers––areas especially
					important to us as queer artists of color. We want words in your
					kitchen and your bathroom and your car (if you have one) and on your
					body and head and feet (if you have them).
				</p>

					Active Chapter was founded in 2024 by artists Eka Savajol, Lucia
					Mumma, Max Chu, and XY Zhou. Our intern is Jojo Savajol.

					Our current project is Active Chapter’s first journal, Confessions of
					Love. We gathered these pieces from our friends, former lovers, and
					childhood best friends. We wanted, not only to gather their thoughts
					on love, but to gather our loved ones together, to see their passions
					materialized, congealed, brought together in the union of a
					collective. Next, we will be collecting work for our Summer release,
					In the Mood for Love. Stay tuned.
